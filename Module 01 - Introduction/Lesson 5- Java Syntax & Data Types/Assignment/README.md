# Assignment: Understanding Java Input and Basic Operators
In this assignment, you will analyze and modify a provided Java program to understand the use of the Scanner class for input, as well as some basic operators in Java. The original code is as follows:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class input {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        int x = 10;
        int y = 11;
        System.out.println(x>y);
        System.out.println(x==y);
        System.out.println(x!=y);
        System.out.println(x%y);
        System.out.println(x>=9);
    }
}
```
# Task 1: Understanding the Code
What is the purpose of import java.util.Scanner at the beginning of the program?
What does the Scanner class do?
What does the System.out.println(x>y) statement do? What will it output and why?
What does the System.out.println(x==y) statement do? What will it output and why?
What does the System.out.println(x!=y) statement do? What will it output and why?
What does the System.out.println(x%y) statement do? What will it output and why?
What does the System.out.println(x>=9) statement do? What will it output and why?
# Task 2: Uncommenting and Understanding the Code
Uncomment the commented code and answer the following questions:

What does the int a = in.nextInt() line do?
What does the float b = in.nextFloat() line do?
What does the boolean check = in.nextBoolean() line do?
What does the char ch = in.next().charAt(0) line do?
What does the String str = in.next() line do?
What does the String str =in.nextLine() line do?
# Task 3: Modifying the Code
## Modify the code to do the following:

Ask the user to input two integers, a and b.
Print out the sum, difference, product, and quotient (as a floating-point number) of a and b.
Ask the user to input a boolean value, a character, and a line of text.
Print out the boolean value, character, and line of text.
