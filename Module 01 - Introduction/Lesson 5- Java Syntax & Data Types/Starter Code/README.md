# Java Data Types Assignment
## Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to understand the various data types in Java and how to use them. By the end of this assignment, you should be familiar with the following data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean, and String.

# Assignment Description:

1. Create a new class named DataTypeDemo.

2. Inside the DataTypeDemo class, create a main method.

3. Within the main method, declare a variable of type byte and assign it a value. Print out this value to the console.

4. Declare a variable of type short and assign it a value. Print out this value to the console.
