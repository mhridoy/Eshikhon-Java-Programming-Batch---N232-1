# Python Basics Assignment: For Loops with If-Else

## Objective: Familiarize yourself with the basic usage of for loops and if-else conditions in Python.

### Positive or Negative:

Write a Python program that prompts the user to input 5 numbers (one at a time).
For each number, the program should print whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
### Even or Odd:

Write a Python program that prompts the user to input 10 numbers (one at a time).
For each number, the program should print whether the number is even or odd.
### Multiples of a Number:

### Write a Python program that asks the user for a number n.
Print the first 10 multiples of n.

### Write a Python program that asks the user to input 5 grades (between 0 and 100).
For each grade:
If the grade is between 90 and 100, print "A".
If the grade is between 80 and 89, print "B".
If the grade is between 70 and 79, print "C".
If the grade is between 60 and 69, print "D".
If the grade is below 60, print "F".
